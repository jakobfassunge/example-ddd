*** I have the following project for DDD:

* Domain Description
A bike sharing application allows users to rent bicycles from various stations located throughout a city. Bicycles can be rented by any registered user, but a single bicycle can only be rented by one user at a time. The bicycles are categorized into standard, electric, and tandem types, each with distinct rental fees. Electric bicycles require the user to have a valid "electric bike permit" to rent. Users can hold a maximum of two active rentals at any given time, while business accounts may have a fleet of up to ten active rentals simultaneously for corporate use. A rental session starts when a user unlocks a bicycle using the application and is completed when the bicycle is returned to any designated station. If a rental session exceeds its allotted time, it incurs a penalty fee.

The application offers various membership plans that affect rental rates and available bicycles. For instance, premium members enjoy discounted rates and can access reserved premium bicycles at select stations. Users can have a reservation hold on a bicycle for a limited time, up to 15 minutes, after which the hold will expire if not activated by starting a rental session. Reservations cannot be made if a user has reached the maximum allowed rentals.

Bicycles undergo regular maintenance checks, which are automatically scheduled based on usage data. If a bicycle requires maintenance, it is flagged as unavailable until the issues are resolved. Users can report issues through the application during or after their rental session.

Users can view their rental history, outstanding dues, and other account details through their profile within the application. The application provides a real-time map with the availability of bicycles and open docks at stations, helping users plan their trips. Users can also use the map to locate nearby charging stations for electric bicycles.

The bike sharing system keeps track of bicycles as part of its inventory. Each bicycle is identified by a unique serial number and is linked to a specific station when docked. New bicycles can be added to the system's inventory and assigned to a station. The application ensures proper syncing between the physical locations and the digital inventory.

To provide a smooth user experience, system components such as user notifications for reservation expirations, maintenance alerts, overdue rentals, and more operate seamlessly in the background. This ensures the system consistently meets user needs and operational standards.


I want you to continue with the process for this domain with some output of big picture event storming

Event storming is a collaborative workshop technique used to swiftly discover and map out the key events and processes in a domain. It's highly useful in domains like your bike sharing application for discovering complex workflows, interactions, and user stories. Here, I'll describe a big picture event storming process for your domain, focusing on major events, commands, and actors.

*** Key Concepts
1. *Events*: Significant occurrences in the domain that are of interest to the business. Events are generally past-tense verbs.
2. *Commands*: Actions that actors (users or systems) initiate. Commands can be seen as requests or instructions to the system.
3. *Actors*: Users or systems that interact with the domain.

*** Big Picture Event Storming

1. *Identify Key Events*
   - User Registered
   - Bicycle Reserved
   - Reservation Expired
   - Rental Session Started
   - Rental Session Ended
   - Bicycle Returned to Station
   - Penalty Fee Incurred
   - Issue Reported
   - Bicycle Scheduled for Maintenance
   - Bicycle Flagged Unavailable
   - Membership Plan Changed
   - Dues Paid
   - Bicycle Added to Inventory
   - Bicycle Assigned to Station
   - Notification Sent (Reservation Expiration, Overdue Rental, etc.)

2. *Identify Commands*
   - Register User
   - Reserve Bicycle
   - Start Rental Session
   - End Rental Session
   - Return Bicycle
   - Report Issue
   - Schedule Maintenance
   - Change Membership Plan
   - Pay Dues
   - Add Bicycle to Inventory
   - Assign Bicycle to Station
   - Send Notification

3. *Identify Actors*
   - End Users
   - Business Account Users
   - System/Maintenance Scheduler
   - Customer Support
   - Notification System
   - Inventory Manager

*** Integration of Events, Commands, and Actors

1. *User Journey: Rent a Bicycle*
   - *Events*: User Registered -> Bicycle Reserved -> Rental Session Started -> Rental Session Ended -> Bicycle Returned to Station
   - *Commands*: Register User -> Reserve Bicycle -> Start Rental Session -> End Rental Session -> Return Bicycle
   - *Actors*: End User

2. *Maintenance Workflow*
   - *Events*: Issue Reported -> Bicycle Scheduled for Maintenance -> Bicycle Flagged Unavailable -> Bicycle Available
   - *Commands*: Report Issue -> Schedule Maintenance -> Flag Bicycle Unavailable -> Mark Bicycle Available
   - *Actors*: End User, System/Maintenance Scheduler, Customer Support

3. *Account Management*
   - *Events*: Membership Plan Changed -> Dues Paid
   - *Commands*: Change Membership Plan -> Pay Dues
   - *Actors*: End User, Business Account User

4. *System Monitoring and Notifications*
   - *Events*: Reservation Expired -> Notification Sent
   - *Commands*: Send Notification
   - *Actors*: Notification System

5. *Inventory Management*
   - *Events*: Bicycle Added to Inventory -> Bicycle Assigned to Station
   - *Commands*: Add Bicycle to Inventory -> Assign Bicycle to Station
   - *Actors*: Inventory Manager

*** Visualizing the Event Storm

It's helpful to create a visual representation of these components using large, color-coded sticky notes on a board or virtual whiteboard. Typically, you'll use:

- Orange sticky notes for events,
- Blue sticky notes for commands,
- Yellow sticky notes for actors or systems.

Connect these notes with arrows to demonstrate the flow from commands to events and the triggering actors. This visualization helps in quickly conveying the entire domain model to a wide range of stakeholders and discovering any missing processes or oversights.

*** Further Steps
- *Break Down Bounded Contexts*: Identify potential boundaries for your domain models that encapsulate related events, commands, and entities.
- *Detail Out User Stories*: For each user journey, elaborate on the user stories that need development.
- *Identify Aggregates*: Within each bounded context, identify aggregates that maintain the integrity of your domain entities and processes.

By following this structured approach, you'll have a clear and holistic view of the bike sharing application's domain, facilitating subsequent steps in development, design, and architecture.

*** Can you build these visual representation using mermaid?

Certainly! Mermaid is great for producing diagrams from text descriptions. However, please note that Mermaid mainly supports flowcharts and sequence diagrams, but it might not capture the full breadth of an event storming, which typically includes a lot of nuanced context. I'll give you a basic flowchart as a starting point:

#+begin_src mermaid :results file :file ./event_storming.svg

    I2[Bicycle Assigned to Station]
    I1 --> I2
  end
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./event_storming.svg]]

*** Explanation:

- *User Journey:* This flowchart covers the registration, reservation, rental, and returning process. It also shows how penalties are incurred if the rental exceeds time.
- *Maintenance Workflow:* Displays the lifecycle of a reported issue through to bike availability post-maintenance.
- *Account Management:* Captures events related to changes in membership and dues.
- *System Monitoring:* Shows how reservations trigger notifications.
- *Inventory Management:* Illustrates the inventory process from bike addition to station assignment.

This flowchart is a simplified representation and can be expanded by adding more details or parallel workflows as needed for your domain. Each section reflects a potential bounded context and can be developed further based on team needs.

*** I want you to create one graph per user-story

Certainly! Let's break down the event storming into separate graphs for each user story. Each graph will focus on a specific interaction or workflow within your domain.

1. *User Story: Rent a Bicycle*

   This user story covers the process from user registration through to returning a rented bicycle, including reservation expiration.

This series of graphs breaks down your system's major workflows and can be used to focus discussions or development efforts on individual areas of the domain. If you need further elaborations or additional user stories, feel free to ask!

*** This is good now we have Events, Commands and some User-Journeys. The next step is to find Definitions for the domain objects

Great! Defining domain objects is an essential step in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). These objects represent key concepts within your domain and help structure interactions and data. I'll help you identify and define these domain objects based on the information we've mapped in the user stories and events.

These domain objects encapsulate the core business logic and interactions within your bike-sharing application. Each object serves a distinct purpose and is aligned with the business processes you've identified. This foundation will assist in further developing your system's architecture and implementation. If necessary, you can expand or refine these definitions as your understanding of the domain evolves.

*** No I mean for example
- Station :: A place which can hold Bicycles
- FullStation :: A station which has reached it's bicycle capacity
- EmptyStation :: A station which has no bicycles currently

this kind of definitions is what i want for the domain

Got it! You're looking for succinct, glossary-like definitions for key domain concepts. Here's a list of domain object definitions for your bike sharing application:

1. *User* :: An individual or business entity registered in the system that can rent bicycles.

2. *RegisteredUser* :: A user who has successfully completed the registration process.

3. *BusinessAccountUser* :: A user representing a corporate account, capable of managing multiple bike rentals.

4. *ElectricBikePermit* :: Authorization required for a user to rent electric bicycles.

5. *Bicycle* :: A vehicle available for rent in the bike-sharing system, including standard, electric, and tandem types.

6. *StandardBicycle* :: A conventional bicycle without any electric assistance features.

7. *ElectricBicycle* :: A bicycle equipped with an electric motor that requires a valid permit to rent.

8. *TandemBicycle* :: A bicycle designed to be ridden by two people.

9. *Station* :: A designated location where bicycles are docked and can be rented or returned.

10. *FullStation* :: A station that has reached its maximum capacity of docked bicycles, preventing additional returns.

11. *EmptyStation* :: A station with no bicycles available for rent.

12. *RentalSession* :: A time period initiated when a bicycle is rented and concluded when it is returned to a station.

13. *Reservation* :: A temporary hold placed on a bicycle to keep it available for a user up to a predefined expiration time.

14. *MembershipPlan* :: A subscription offering that affects rental rates and bicycle access privileges for users.

15. *PremiumBicycle* :: A specially designated bicycle available only to premium members.

16. *PenaltyFee* :: An additional charge incurred when a rental session exceeds the designated rental time.

17. *MaintenanceCheck* :: A routine inspection performed to ensure bicycles are safe and in good working order.

18. *UnavailableBicycle* :: A bicycle that is not available for rent due to maintenance requirements or being out of service.

19. *Notification* :: An automated alert sent to users regarding reservation expirations, overdue rentals, maintenance alerts, and other important information.

20. *Inventory* :: The complete collection of bicycles managed by the system, tracked by location and availability.

These definitions serve as a glossary for key concepts in your domain, providing clarity and shared understanding among stakeholders and team members. They can help streamline development, communication, and documentation efforts.

*** I want you to write these definitions in a mermaid diagram where one big heading is definitions, and every definition has its own box below that

Certainly! Here's how you can represent these domain definitions using a Mermaid diagram:

#+begin_src mermaid
graph TD
    A[Definitions]

    A --> B[User: An individual or business entity registered in the system that can rent bicycles.]
    A --> C[RegisteredUser: A user who has successfully completed the registration process.]
    A --> D[BusinessAccountUser: A user representing a corporate account, capable of managing multiple bike rentals.]
    A --> E[ElectricBikePermit: Authorization required for a user to rent electric bicycles.]
    A --> F[Bicycle: A vehicle available for rent in the bike-sharing system, including standard, electric, and tandem types.]
    A --> G[StandardBicycle: A conventional bicycle without any electric assistance features.]
    A --> H[ElectricBicycle: A bicycle equipped with an electric motor that requires a valid permit to rent.]
    A --> I[TandemBicycle: A bicycle designed to be ridden by two people.]
    A --> J[Station: A designated location where bicycles are docked and can be rented or returned.]
    A --> K[FullStation: A station that has reached its maximum capacity of docked bicycles, preventing additional returns.]
    A --> L[EmptyStation: A station with no bicycles available for rent.]
    A --> M[RentalSession: A time period initiated when a bicycle is rented and concluded when it is returned to a station.]
    A --> N[Reservation: A temporary hold placed on a bicycle to keep it available for a user up to a predefined expiration time.]
    A --> O[MembershipPlan: A subscription offering that affects rental rates and bicycle access privileges for users.]
    A --> P[PremiumBicycle: A specially designated bicycle available only to premium members.]
    A --> Q[PenaltyFee: An additional charge incurred when a rental session exceeds the designated rental time.]
    A --> R[MaintenanceCheck: A routine inspection performed to ensure bicycles are safe and in good working order.]
    A --> S[UnavailableBicycle: A bicycle that is not available for rent due to maintenance requirements or being out of service.]
    A --> T[Notification: An automated alert sent to users regarding reservation expirations, overdue rentals, maintenance alerts, and other important information.]
    A --> U[Inventory: The complete collection of bicycles managed by the system, tracked by location and availability.]
#+end_src

In this diagram, each definition is a separate node connected to the main heading "Definitions." To render this, you can use a tool that supports Mermaid syntax, as the text format of Mermaid allows for easy integration and updates.

*** Alright the next step is to identify the different Bounded Contexts of the Domain. Please do that for me

Identifying bounded contexts is a crucial step in Domain-Driven Design (DDD), as it allows you to partition a complex domain into manageable, cohesive segments. Each bounded context focuses on a specific sub-domain, encapsulating the associated business logic, data, and rules.

For your bike-sharing application, we can outline several potential bounded contexts based on the domain objects and interactions identified earlier:

1. *User Management Context*
   - Focus: Handling user registration, authentication, profile management, membership plans, and dues.
   - Key Domain Objects: User, RegisteredUser, BusinessAccountUser, MembershipPlan
   - Primary Processes: User registration, membership plan changes, dues management.

2. *Rental Management Context*
   - Focus: Activities related to renting and returning bicycles, managing rental sessions, and handling penalties.
   - Key Domain Objects: RentalSession, PenaltyFee, Bicycle, StandardBicycle, ElectricBicycle, TandemBicycle
   - Primary Processes: Starting/ending rental sessions, calculating penalties.

3. *Reservation Context*
   - Focus: Managing the reservation process for bicycles.
   - Key Domain Objects: Reservation, Bicycle
   - Primary Processes: Creating and expiring reservations, handling reservation holds.

4. *Station Management Context*
   - Focus: Managing stations and the availability of bicycles at each station.
   - Key Domain Objects: Station, FullStation, EmptyStation, Bicycle
   - Primary Processes: Updating station availability, handling full and empty station status.

5. *Inventory Management Context*
   - Focus: Lifecycle and location management of bicycles within the system.
   - Key Domain Objects: Inventory, Bicycle
   - Primary Processes: Adding, removing, and relocating bicycles in the inventory.

6. *Maintenance Context*
   - Focus: Scheduling and performing maintenance on bicycles.
   - Key Domain Objects: Bicycle, MaintenanceCheck, UnavailableBicycle
   - Primary Processes: Reporting issues, scheduling, and performing maintenance checks.

7. *Notification Context*
   - Focus: Managing the notification system for alerts like reservations, maintenance, and dues.
   - Key Domain Objects: Notification, Reservation
   - Primary Processes: Sending various alerts, managing notification rules.

These bounded contexts help to encapsulate distinct areas of the bike-sharing application's domain. They facilitate clear communication among team members, provide a structure for dividing development work, and help maintain focus on the respective business problems each context addresses. As the project evolves, you may find the need to refine or adjust these contexts based on deeper domain insights or changing business requirements.

*** Now it is time to create the aggregates. I want you to also provide a plantuml-diagramm for the aggregates

Creating aggregates involves grouping related entities and value objects that ensure data integrity and encapsulate business logic within each bounded context. Aggregates are pivotal in maintaining consistency within a bounded context.

Based on the bounded contexts identified, here are the suggested aggregates, along with a PlantUML diagram to visualize them:

*** Aggregates

1. *User Management Context*
   - *User Aggregate*
     - Entities: User, MembershipPlan
     - Responsibilities: Managing user details, membership changes, and dues.

2. *Rental Management Context*
   - *RentalSession Aggregate*
     - Entities: RentalSession, Bicycle (as part of the session)
     - Value Objects: PenaltyFee
     - Responsibilities: Managing rental session lifecycle, starting and ending rentals, calculating penalties.

3. *Reservation Context*
   - *Reservation Aggregate*
     - Entities: Reservation, Bicycle (linked to reservation)
     - Responsibilities: Managing reservation lifecycle, holding bicycles.

4. *Station Management Context*
   - *Station Aggregate*
     - Entities: Station, Bicycle (docked at the station)
     - Responsibilities: Handling station capacity, dock availability.

5. *Inventory Management Context*
   - *Inventory Aggregate*
     - Entities: Inventory, Bicycle
     - Responsibilities: Managing bicycle lifecycle and inventory status.

6. *Maintenance Context*
   - *Maintenance Aggregate*
     - Entities: MaintenanceCheck, Bicycle (under maintenance)
     - Responsibilities: Scheduling and completing maintenance tasks, bike availability during maintenance.

7. *Notification Context*
   - *Notification Aggregate*
     - Entities: Notification
     - Responsibilities: Generating and sending notifications.

*** PlantUML Diagram

Here's a PlantUML representation of these aggregates:

#+begin_src plantuml :results file :file ./aggregates.svg

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./aggregates.svg]]

This PlantUML diagram visually encapsulates the aggregates within each bounded context, following DDD guidelines to structure your domain models. Each aggregate ensures that its related entities and operations are logically grouped, maintaining consistency and integrity within its bounded context.

*** I want you to expand on the aggregates by providing AggregateRoots, Aggregates and ValueObjects in the uml and a diagram showing how they connect

Certainly! In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), aggregates encompass entities and value objects, with the aggregate root being the main entity through which all interactions with the aggregate occur. Here's an expanded version of the aggregates with aggregate roots, aggregates, and value objects, along with a connecting diagram.

   - /Aggregate Root/: User
   - /Entities/: MembershipPlan
   - /Value Objects/: User ID, ElectricBikePermit

2. *Rental Management Context*
   - /Aggregate Root/: RentalSession
   - /Entities/: Bicycle (as part of the session)
   - /Value Objects/: Session ID, PenaltyFee

3. *Reservation Context*
   - /Aggregate Root/: Reservation
   - /Entities/: Bicycle (linked to reservation)
   - /Value Objects/: Reservation ID, Expiry Time
