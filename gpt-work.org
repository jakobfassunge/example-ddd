*** I have the following project for DDD:

* Domain Description
A bike sharing application allows users to rent bicycles from various stations located throughout a city. Bicycles can be rented by any registered user, but a single bicycle can only be rented by one user at a time. The bicycles are categorized into standard, electric, and tandem types, each with distinct rental fees. Electric bicycles require the user to have a valid "electric bike permit" to rent. Users can hold a maximum of two active rentals at any given time, while business accounts may have a fleet of up to ten active rentals simultaneously for corporate use. A rental session starts when a user unlocks a bicycle using the application and is completed when the bicycle is returned to any designated station. If a rental session exceeds its allotted time, it incurs a penalty fee.

The application offers various membership plans that affect rental rates and available bicycles. For instance, premium members enjoy discounted rates and can access reserved premium bicycles at select stations. Users can have a reservation hold on a bicycle for a limited time, up to 15 minutes, after which the hold will expire if not activated by starting a rental session. Reservations cannot be made if a user has reached the maximum allowed rentals.

Bicycles undergo regular maintenance checks, which are automatically scheduled based on usage data. If a bicycle requires maintenance, it is flagged as unavailable until the issues are resolved. Users can report issues through the application during or after their rental session.

Users can view their rental history, outstanding dues, and other account details through their profile within the application. The application provides a real-time map with the availability of bicycles and open docks at stations, helping users plan their trips. Users can also use the map to locate nearby charging stations for electric bicycles.

The bike sharing system keeps track of bicycles as part of its inventory. Each bicycle is identified by a unique serial number and is linked to a specific station when docked. New bicycles can be added to the system's inventory and assigned to a station. The application ensures proper syncing between the physical locations and the digital inventory.

To provide a smooth user experience, system components such as user notifications for reservation expirations, maintenance alerts, overdue rentals, and more operate seamlessly in the background. This ensures the system consistently meets user needs and operational standards.


I want you to continue with the process for this domain with some output of big picture event storming

Event storming is a collaborative workshop technique used to swiftly discover and map out the key events and processes in a domain. It's highly useful in domains like your bike sharing application for discovering complex workflows, interactions, and user stories. Here, I'll describe a big picture event storming process for your domain, focusing on major events, commands, and actors.

*** Key Concepts
1. *Events*: Significant occurrences in the domain that are of interest to the business. Events are generally past-tense verbs.
2. *Commands*: Actions that actors (users or systems) initiate. Commands can be seen as requests or instructions to the system.
3. *Actors*: Users or systems that interact with the domain.

*** Big Picture Event Storming

1. *Identify Key Events*
   - User Registered
   - Bicycle Reserved
   - Reservation Expired
   - Rental Session Started
   - Rental Session Ended
   - Bicycle Returned to Station
   - Penalty Fee Incurred
   - Issue Reported
   - Bicycle Scheduled for Maintenance
   - Bicycle Flagged Unavailable
   - Membership Plan Changed
   - Dues Paid
   - Bicycle Added to Inventory
   - Bicycle Assigned to Station
   - Notification Sent (Reservation Expiration, Overdue Rental, etc.)

2. *Identify Commands*
   - Register User
   - Reserve Bicycle
   - Start Rental Session
   - End Rental Session
   - Return Bicycle
   - Report Issue
   - Schedule Maintenance
   - Change Membership Plan
   - Pay Dues
   - Add Bicycle to Inventory
   - Assign Bicycle to Station
   - Send Notification

3. *Identify Actors*
   - End Users
   - Business Account Users
   - System/Maintenance Scheduler
   - Customer Support
   - Notification System
   - Inventory Manager

*** Integration of Events, Commands, and Actors

1. *User Journey: Rent a Bicycle*
   - *Events*: User Registered -> Bicycle Reserved -> Rental Session Started -> Rental Session Ended -> Bicycle Returned to Station
   - *Commands*: Register User -> Reserve Bicycle -> Start Rental Session -> End Rental Session -> Return Bicycle
   - *Actors*: End User

2. *Maintenance Workflow*
   - *Events*: Issue Reported -> Bicycle Scheduled for Maintenance -> Bicycle Flagged Unavailable -> Bicycle Available
   - *Commands*: Report Issue -> Schedule Maintenance -> Flag Bicycle Unavailable -> Mark Bicycle Available
   - *Actors*: End User, System/Maintenance Scheduler, Customer Support

3. *Account Management*
   - *Events*: Membership Plan Changed -> Dues Paid
   - *Commands*: Change Membership Plan -> Pay Dues
   - *Actors*: End User, Business Account User

4. *System Monitoring and Notifications*
   - *Events*: Reservation Expired -> Notification Sent
   - *Commands*: Send Notification
   - *Actors*: Notification System

5. *Inventory Management*
   - *Events*: Bicycle Added to Inventory -> Bicycle Assigned to Station
   - *Commands*: Add Bicycle to Inventory -> Assign Bicycle to Station
   - *Actors*: Inventory Manager

*** Visualizing the Event Storm

It's helpful to create a visual representation of these components using large, color-coded sticky notes on a board or virtual whiteboard. Typically, you'll use:

- Orange sticky notes for events,
- Blue sticky notes for commands,
- Yellow sticky notes for actors or systems.

Connect these notes with arrows to demonstrate the flow from commands to events and the triggering actors. This visualization helps in quickly conveying the entire domain model to a wide range of stakeholders and discovering any missing processes or oversights.

*** Further Steps
- *Break Down Bounded Contexts*: Identify potential boundaries for your domain models that encapsulate related events, commands, and entities.
- *Detail Out User Stories*: For each user journey, elaborate on the user stories that need development.
- *Identify Aggregates*: Within each bounded context, identify aggregates that maintain the integrity of your domain entities and processes.

By following this structured approach, you'll have a clear and holistic view of the bike sharing application's domain, facilitating subsequent steps in development, design, and architecture.
